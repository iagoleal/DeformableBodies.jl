# Falling cat simulator
Little simulation of a falling cat I made for my scientific initiation.
I still have to work a little more on this code.

The main goal is to upgrade it to a general falling body simulator,
where the user just have the enter the points and initial trajectories and the program will do the rest.

(no real cats where harmed during the process of getting the empirical data)
